                    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content.</p> 

                    <p>"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. </p>

                    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language; it is a markup language used to tell your browser how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wishes it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a bit of content into a hyperlink to link to another page on the web, italicize words, and so on.  For example, take the following line of content:
                </p>
                <pre class="html-sentence">
                  <code class="html sentence">
                      The door is not real.
                  </code>
                </pre>
                <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph 
                    <pre>
                    <code> "p" </code> element:</p>
                    </pre>
            </section>
